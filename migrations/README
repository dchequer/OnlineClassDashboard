Single-database configuration for Flask.

To set up migrations
In the command prompt, enter the following command:
(This only has to be done the first time)
```
flask db init
```

The last command will create a migrations folder in root directory.

To start a new migration:
If a change is made to any of the models, run the following command:
```
flask db migrate
```

This command will create a python script in the migrations/versions folder that reflects the detected changes

Finally to "push" these changes to the sqlite database, run this command:
```
flask db upgrade
```
